In addition the (filtered) output image, display also the Fourier transform of the filter, and the element-wise product of the Fourier transforms of the image and the filter. Try to figure out the relationship between the size of the mean filter and its Fourier transform. Repeat this analysis on the standard deviation."

    ">A practical implication of the convolution theorem is the computational saving it may offer by performing computations in the frequency domain instead of in the spatial domain. Carry out a study of the running times for differnt sizes of the mask filter, and for different image sizes. Display a plot of the measured times (mean and deviation) to appreciate  the influence of the image size for a given mask size, and another plot where the image size is fixed and the mask size is varied. Observe the results carefully, and comment on them."
